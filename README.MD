I was trying to easily know who doesn't follow me back on Twitter.
After some researches I found it would be easier to create a program for that...

In order to make it work:
<ul><li>npm install</li>
<li>update file main.js and replace variable myself with your own twitter id (a number)</li>
<li>update file twitterkeys.js and add your application tokens and you own tokens</li>
<li>node twitter</li>
